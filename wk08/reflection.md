Dual-path complexity: Was it harder to maintain HTMX and no-JS paths than you expected? What helped keep them in sync?

Error handling: How did accessible error identification change your approach? Did you discover any WCAG requirements you hadn’t considered?

Trade-offs: Which trade-off (e.g., no-JS delete confirmation) felt most significant? Would you design it differently with more time?

Testing: How useful was the scripted no-JS verification? Will you use similar scripts in future projects?

Inclusion impact: Who specifically benefits from the dual-path architecture? Think about connectivity, device age, organisational policies.

Next steps: What would you improve before Week 9 instrumentation? Any technical debt to address?
